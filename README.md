The goal of ‘wei\_lda\_debate’ is to build Latent Dirichlet Allocation
models based on ‘sklearn’ and ‘gensim’ framework, and Dynamic Topic
Model based on ‘gensim’ framework. I decide to build a Python package,
so this reposority will be updated. The new reposority path is
github.com/JiaxiangBU/dynamic\_topic\_modeling.
